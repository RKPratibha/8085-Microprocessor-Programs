Hello everyone, I have created this repository to help students, who are starting their career in Computer Engineering. As we know The Intel 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in 1977. It
was binary compatible with the more-famous Intel 8080 but required less  supporting hardware, thus allowing simpler and less expensive microcomputer systems to be built. The "5" in the model number came from the fact that the
8085 requires only a +5-Volt (V) power supply rather than the +5 V, −5 V and +12 V supplies the 8080 needed. The main features of 8085 μP are:
1. It is an 8-bit microprocessor.
2. It is manufactured with N-MOS technology.
3. It has 16-bit address bus and hence can address up to 216= 65536 bytes (64KB) memory locations through A0–A15.
4. The first 8 lines of address bus and 8 lines of data bus are multiplexed AD0–AD7
5. Data bus is a group of 8 lines D0–D7.
6. It supports external interrupt request.
7. A 16-bit program counter (PC)
8. A 16-bit stack pointer (SP)
9. Six 8-bit general purpose register arranged in pairs: BC, DE, HL.
10. It requires a signal +5V power supply and operates at 3.2 MHZ single phase clock.
11. It is enclosed with 40 pins DIP (Dual in line package
