##Write a program in 8085 assembly language to transfer data block in direct order.

LXI H, 2500 ; Load HL with the source memory address 2500H
LXI D, 2600 ; Load DE with the destination memory address 2600H
MVI C, 0A ; Load C with the number of bytes to transfer (10 bytes)
AGAIN: MOV A,M ; Move the content from the source (HL) to the accumulator (A)
STAX D ; Store the content of A in the destination (pointed by DE)
INX H ; Increment HL to point to the next source byte
INX D ; Increment DE to point to the next destination byte
DCR C ; Decrement C (the counter for number of bytes left)
JNZ AGAIN ; If C is not zero, jump to AGAIN and repeat the process
HLT ; Stop the program when all bytes have been transferred
#ORG 2500H
#DB 01H,02H,03H,04H,05H,06H,07H,08H,09H,0AH

##	Write a program in 8085 assembly language to transfer data block in reverse order.

LXI H, 2500 ; Load HL with the starting address of the source (2500H)
LXI D, 2609 ; Load DE with the starting address of the destination (2609H)
MVI C, 0A ; Load C with the number of bytes to transfer (10 bytes)
AGAIN: MOV A,M ; Move the content from memory at HL into the accumulator
STAX D ; Store the content of A into the memory location pointed to by DE
INX H ; Increment HL to point to the next source memory location
DCX D ; Decrement DE to move to the previous destination memory location
DCR C ; Decrement the counter C
JNZ AGAIN ; If C is not zero, jump to AGAIN and continue the process
HLT ; Halt the program
#ORG 2500H
#DB 01H,02H,03H,04H,05H,06H,07H,08H,09H,0AH
